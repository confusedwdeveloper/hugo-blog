### New and shiny thing

A few months ago, I was going through GatsbyJs documentations and, I was amazed to see how easy it was to set up complex react apps with gatsby starter packs. I was excited to finally be able to set up a blog with minimum effort enabling me to focus on the content. It took me just 30 minutes to follow the written instructions and be up and running with my blog.

### The Problem

A few days ago, I discovered that my blog was not updated when I added new content. I noticed that one of my core node package related to images was broken, which was preventing the build process. It took me 2 hours to fix the problem, which was frustrating because I could've spent that time writing new content or working on a new project. I realized that it is better to simplify the build process so that I can focus on the content without worrying about any of my 30000 packages in node module.

### Enter Hugo

I came across Hugo when I was looking for a static site generator that is fast and works without too much manual coding. I was surprised when going through Hugo documentation because of how easy it is. It took me barely 5 minutes to choose a theme and get up and running with a new site. It taught me not to force static site generators for every website I make.
