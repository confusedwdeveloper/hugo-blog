My name is Darshan Datta. I am a self-taught full-stack web and mobile developer. I am proficient at web technologies such as React, React Native, NodeJs, MongoDB, graphQL, etc. Some of my favorite hobbies include reading fantasy books and following international chess tournaments.  
I am looking for a job that provides me with ample learning opportunities as well as allowing me to work with the latest technologies that are available.
